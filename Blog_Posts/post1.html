	    <center> <h1> Python Problems for fun! </h1> </center>
	    <p> Hello World! Today, I'll be doing a series of python problems, and I'll be explaining my thinking behind the logic of these problems. For me, personally, I'm just doing this to pass my time during Winter Break, but I really hope you learn from this post if you're looking into entering python programming. </p>

	    <p> I'll be getting all the problems from : https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises </p>

	    <p> Yes, I'm aware that solutions are provided, but the logic behind the solutions is not. I aim to provide logical thinking along with my own code. I will try my best not to look at the solutions unless I want to check my answer. </p>

	    <p> Let's get started! </p>

	    <p> Problem 1: </p>
	    <p> Question: Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Hints: Consider use range(#begin, #end) method </p>
	    <p> This problem is asking us to find numbers behind 2000 and 3200 which are divisible by 7 and are not a multiple of 5. It seems like a pretty straight-forward question, and I believe that the answer should be straight forward as well. The hint that they give is for us to use in our for-loop. </p>

	    	<div class="col no-gutters">
	    		<div class="leftside">

	    	</div>
	    	<div class="col no-gutters">
		    	<div class="rightside">
		    		<p> In this problem, I start off by creating a list called eligible_numbers which will basically collect all the numbers that meet our condition and put them in the list. I then create a for-loop to search through between 2000 and <strong> 3201 </strong>. 3201 because I want to make sure that 3200 is counted in the range. If I made it from 2000 to 3200, then the for-loop would stop after 2900. I then have an if-condition checking for our required condition. I'll append every value between this range that meets our condition to the eligible_numbers list. </p>
		    		<p> After this loop, I create another one to try to print all the eligible numbers. I append them to a variable a, and I use string formatting techniques to get rid of the last space and comma. This way, I have a good output. </p>

	    </div>  
	    <p> Problem 2: </p>
	    <p> Question: Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: 40320 </p>
	    <p> Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. </p>
	    <p> This problem is asking us to compute the factorial of a given number. So, if we were given 4 for example, the factorial would be : 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 </p>

	    	<div class="col no-gutters">

	    	<div class="col no-gutters">
		    	<div class="rightside">
		    		<p> I started this problem off by taking in user-input. I have a try-except statement as I am implementing error handling. If the user enters a string value, or anything that isn't an integer, a ValueError will rise, causing the program to go to the except statement and automatically quitting. If the user types in a negative value, the program will quit. Anything else will work. </p> 
		    		<p> I set the initial value of the answer to 1 and I multiply answer by the check value, which is set to the integer value of the user-input. This way, as the check value decrements by 1, it keeps getting multiplied into the final answer. Sure enough, if you enter 8, you'll get 40320 as given in the original example. </p>

	    <p> Problem 3: </p>
	    <p> Question: With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64} </p>
	    <p> Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. Consider use dict(). </p>
	    <p> This problem requires the programmer to square each number between 1 and a number n provided by the user, and input everything into a dictionary. It's basically a closed-interval domain. </p>

	    	<div class="col no-gutters">

		    		<p> The implementation for this problem was extremely similar to the one for Problem 2. This problem uses the same error-handling technique. </p>
		    		<p> I created a dictionary using dict() as given in the hint. Then, I created a for loop that went from 1 to <strong> (check + 1). </strong> It has to go till (check + 1) because we want it to count till check. Then, I just appended each value of the dictionary as key squared. The keys for the dictionary are just the numbers 1 to check, as was asked of in the instructions. </p>

	    </div>
	    <p> Problem 4: </p>
	    <p> Question: Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 34,67,55,33,12,98 Then, the output should be: ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98'] ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98') </p>
	    <p> Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. tuple() method can convert list to tuple. </p>
	    <p> This problem requires the programmer to square each number between 1 and a number n provided by the user, and input everything into a dictionary. It's basically a closed-interval domain. </p>
